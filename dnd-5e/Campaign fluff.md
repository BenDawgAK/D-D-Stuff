#### Soulbound:
Soulbound are the product of a magic ritual to bound one's soul to an inatimate object.
Soulbound are commonly created using the souls of noblemen and magic users seeking to cheat death.
On the other hand, many an unwitting soldier has found themselves bound to golems and suits of armor to create nigh unstoppable warriors.
Souldbound are commonly bound to golem like forms, suits of armor, or human remains such as skeletons, while the latter has fallen out of practice.
For the former two types, use the Warforged race, for the latter, use the undead race, which can be found on this repo.
